# Problem 😧
When we participate in Hackathons, We always face one issue that is an ideas for project or inspiration. When we learn a new skill we face problems in implementing it in a project. 

 >  #### So if you face the same problem we are here to help you! 🤩

 # Solution 😃

Project-Zone web-app suggests the user about the projects they can create based on their skills. Like if we learn some new tech, We always search for beginner level projects in node, intermediate level projects in ReactJs, and so on. For this, We have to explore a lot on Google and YouTube to get the projects. So, if we have all these projects in one place it will be very much easier for a beginner to find project ideas!
We have the categories from beginner to startup level project ideas and we also have an option to add new projects.
Our app is in its initial stage, We will improve it a lot. 🔥
